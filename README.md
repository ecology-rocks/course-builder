# 🗺️ Project Roadmap: K9 Course Builder


## Planned Updates (Short Term)
 - Add a "Trial" at "Club" indicator to the print info (by Class Level). 
 - Allow judges to set bale sizes (instead of worrying about 3 stringers)
 - Copy/paste keyboard shortcuts
 - Numbered rat spots for Master
 - Anchor bale marking and anchor bale measurements from walls
 - Official Barn Hunt maps require legends - need to add a legend. 

## Feature Requests & Future Updates (Long Term)
 - Offline caching, offline version, local storage options
 - Validation for class level guidelines
 - Tunnel length measurement tool
 - Public library access for repeatable structures
 - Add a variety of SENIOR and MASTER tunnels to Tunnel Library.
 - Change tracking between levels (for nested course design)
 - Need a gate marker
 - Premade tunnels should indicate EastCoast/WestCoast dimensions
 - Provide options for choosing where grid numbering starts (lower/top left/right)
 - Provide explicit instructions for PDF generation until I build a PDF tool
 

## Bug Reports
 - Lock down club seats to max 5.
 - Start mat should be 4x4 not 2x3
 - Put keyboard shortcuts in tooltips so people know
