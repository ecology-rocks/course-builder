# 🗺️ Project Roadmap: K9 Course Builder
This is my one-true-copy of the project roadmap.

## Feature Requests & Future Updates (Long Term)
 - Offline caching, offline version, local storage options (very long term)
 - Validation for class level guidelines
 - Point to point measurement tool
 - Public library access for repeatable structures
 - Add a variety of SENIOR and MASTER tunnels to Tunnel Library.
 - Premade tunnels should indicate EastCoast/WestCoast dimensions
 - Numbered rat spots for Master
 - Ability to modify subscriptions, add extra seats to club sub, etc. 
 - Documentation + Guides, help button, etc.
 - Increase line thickness on tall bale slash marks so they're visible when printing
 - Include Course Builder map. Judge Map: All levels plus hides. CB Map: All levels. Exhib. Map: 1st Level Only
 - Include reset button for Statistics box in case it errors out.
 - Increase rotation interval to 15 deg.
 - Consider adding a zoom function beyond the scale function at the bottom
 - Perimeter distances and hide locations very small and hard to read. Maybe a menu item to increase/decrease size?
 - Add "Cut" in addition to Copy/Paste. Add buttons for all three.

 
 ## Logic Changes
  - "Select Area" selects things that are merely close to the selection box
  - Prevent Map Statistics Box from moving off grid.
  - Remove double click to delete, it is confusing. Stick to select and delete. 
  - Consider adjusting placement grid to 2" instead of 3"


## Updates in Progress
 - [x] DONE - Changelog between levels (for nested course design)
 - [x] DONE - CSS change to prevent scrolling in sidebar
 - Need markers for gate, step, dead zone, and obstruction
 - Move map statistics box to legend sidebar for printing
 - [x] DONE - DC Mats need more flexibility on rotation and sizing

## EOY Update (2025-12-31)
 - Add a "Trial" at "Club" indicator to the print info (by Class Level). 
 - Allow judges to set bale sizes (instead of worrying about 3 stringers)
 - Copy/paste keyboard shortcuts
 - Anchor bale marking and anchor bale measurements from walls
 - Official Barn Hunt maps require legends - need to add a legend. 
 - Toast notification after successful save
 - Need to be able to label the type of wall/fencing. 
 - Provide options for choosing where grid numbering starts (lower/top left/right)
 - Lock down club seats to max 5.
 - Validation is blocking bale placemen
