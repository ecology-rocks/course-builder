# 🗺️ Project Roadmap: K9 Course Builder
This is my one-true-copy of the project roadmap.

## Updates in Progress
 - Adding code documentation
 - Adding people documentation
 

## Feature Requests & Future Updates (Long Term)
 - Offline caching, offline version, local storage options (very long term)
 - Validation for class level guidelines
 - Area measurement tool (for distance challenge calculation)
 - Public library access for repeatable structures
 - Add a variety of SENIOR and MASTER tunnels to Tunnel Library.
 - Premade tunnels should indicate EastCoast/WestCoast dimensions
 - Numbered rat spots for Master
 - Ability to modify subscriptions, add extra seats to club sub, etc. 
 - Documentation + Guides, help button, etc.
 - Bring to front feature for bales? Would require some redesign.


## Coder's QOL Update (2026-01-08)
 - Adjust Ctrl+C/V so that they work in text inputs and on the map for other things. 
 - Point to point measurement tool
 - Adjusted "Print" buttons so they're clearer (print w/ hides, print w/o hides)
 - Adjusted the size of the Step
 - Refactored BH Layer to prevent cross-contamination
 - Fixed multi-object select and drag
 - Removed DCMats from course settings; made their size editable by clicking on one after placement. 
 - Rearranged editor sidebar so that it makes more logical sense. 
 - Notes box
 - Full board boxes if people prefer (instead of just point-to-point measurement)
 - Duplicate map button available on Dashboard for nested maps. 

## New Year, New Editor Update (2026-01-03)
 - Nested course design: Now you can select a previously saved map to compare to in Course Settings! Comparison will show up in Map Statistics.
 - CSS change to prevent scrolling in sidebar
 - Prevent Map Statistics Box from moving off grid. Moves Map Statistics to printable legend instead of on the map.
 - Remove double click to delete, it is confusing. You can still select and hit Delete key or button.
 - Adjusted placement grid to 2" instead of 3"
 - DC Mat size can now be set in Course Settings. DC Mats can be rotated in 15 degree intervals.
 - All rotateable items should be rotateable in 15 degree increments. "Rotate Group" still only rotates at 90 degrees.
 - Created markers for gate, step, dead zone, and obstruction.

## EOY Update (2025-12-31)
 - Add a "Trial" at "Club" indicator to the print info (by Class Level). 
 - Allow judges to set bale sizes (instead of worrying about 3 stringers)
 - Copy/paste keyboard shortcuts
 - Anchor bale marking and anchor bale measurements from walls
 - Official Barn Hunt maps require legends - need to add a legend. 
 - Toast notification after successful save
 - Need to be able to label the type of wall/fencing. 
 - Provide options for choosing where grid numbering starts (lower/top left/right)
 - Lock down club seats to max 5.
 - Validation is blocking bale placement
