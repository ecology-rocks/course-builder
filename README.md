# 🗺️ Project Roadmap: K9 Course Builder
This is my one-true-copy of the project roadmap.

## Updates in Progress

 

## Feature Requests & Future Updates (Long Term)
 - Offline caching, offline version, local storage options (very long term)
 - Validation for class level guidelines
 - Point to point measurement tool
 - Public library access for repeatable structures
 - Add a variety of SENIOR and MASTER tunnels to Tunnel Library.
 - Premade tunnels should indicate EastCoast/WestCoast dimensions
 - Numbered rat spots for Master
 - Ability to modify subscriptions, add extra seats to club sub, etc. 
 - Documentation + Guides, help button, etc.
 - Increase line thickness on tall bale slash marks so they're visible when printing
 - Include Course Builder map. Judge Map: All levels plus hides. CB Map: All levels. Exhib. Map: 1st Level Only
 - Consider adding a zoom function beyond the scale function at the bottom
 - Perimeter distances and hide locations very small and hard to read. Maybe a menu item to increase/decrease size?
 - Add "Cut" in addition to Copy/Paste. Add buttons for all three.
 - "Select Area" selects things that are merely close to the selection box

## New Year, New Editor Update (2026-01-03)
 - Nested course design: Now you can select a previously saved map to compare to in Course Settings! Comparison will show up in Map Statistics.
 - CSS change to prevent scrolling in sidebar
 - Prevent Map Statistics Box from moving off grid. Moves Map Statistics to printable legend instead of on the map.
 - Remove double click to delete, it is confusing. You can still select and hit Delete key or button.
 - Adjusted placement grid to 2" instead of 3"
 - DC Mat size can now be set in Course Settings. DC Mats can be rotated in 15 degree intervals.
 - All rotateable items should be rotateable in 15 degree increments. "Rotate Group" still only rotates at 90 degrees.
 - Created markers for gate, step, dead zone, and obstruction.

## EOY Update (2025-12-31)
 - Add a "Trial" at "Club" indicator to the print info (by Class Level). 
 - Allow judges to set bale sizes (instead of worrying about 3 stringers)
 - Copy/paste keyboard shortcuts
 - Anchor bale marking and anchor bale measurements from walls
 - Official Barn Hunt maps require legends - need to add a legend. 
 - Toast notification after successful save
 - Need to be able to label the type of wall/fencing. 
 - Provide options for choosing where grid numbering starts (lower/top left/right)
 - Lock down club seats to max 5.
 - Validation is blocking bale placement
